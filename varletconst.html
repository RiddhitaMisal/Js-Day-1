<h1>JavaScript Var Let Const </h1>

    
   <p> Var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. 
       This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.

</p>
   <p>Let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement,
        or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, 
        or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.</p>

   <p>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. 
       const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
       const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.
